# Blockchain Supply Chain - Schneider Electric Collaboration

## Overview

This innovative project represents a groundbreaking collaboration with Schneider Electric to develop a blockchain-based supply chain management system that enhances transparency, accountability, and traceability across complex manufacturing networks. The solution leverages smart contracts and distributed ledger technology to create an immutable, transparent record of supply chain transactions and processes.

## Technical Architecture

The system is built on a robust blockchain infrastructure designed for enterprise-scale supply chain operations:

### Blockchain Infrastructure
- **Ethereum-based smart contracts** for automated transaction processing
- **IPFS integration** for decentralized file storage and document management
- **Consensus mechanisms** optimized for supply chain validation
- **Scalable architecture** supporting high transaction volumes

### Smart Contract Implementation
```solidity
// Supply Chain Smart Contract
contract SupplyChainContract {
    struct Product {
        uint256 productId;
        string name;
        address manufacturer;
        address currentOwner;
        uint256 timestamp;
        string[] certifications;
        bool isVerified;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Product) public products;
    mapping(uint256 => address[]) public productHistory;
    
    function addProduct(uint256 _productId, string memory _name) public {
        products[_productId] = Product({
            productId: _productId,
            name: _name,
            manufacturer: msg.sender,
            currentOwner: msg.sender,
            timestamp: block.timestamp,
            certifications: new string[](0),
            isVerified: false
        });
    }
    
    function transferOwnership(uint256 _productId, address _newOwner) public {
        require(products[_productId].currentOwner == msg.sender, "Not authorized");
        products[_productId].currentOwner = _newOwner;
        productHistory[_productId].push(_newOwner);
    }
}
```
