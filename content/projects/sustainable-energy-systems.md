# Sustainable Energy Management System

## Project Overview

The Sustainable Energy Management System (SEMS) is an IoT-powered platform that optimizes energy consumption in commercial and residential buildings. By combining real-time monitoring, machine learning predictions, and automated control systems, SEMS helps reduce energy costs while promoting environmental sustainability.

## System Architecture

### IoT Sensor Network
- **Temperature sensors** for HVAC optimization
- **Occupancy detectors** for lighting control
- **Power meters** for real-time consumption tracking
- **Environmental sensors** for air quality monitoring

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Edge computing** for local data processing
- **Cloud-based analytics** for historical analysis
- **Real-time streaming** with Apache Kafka
- **Time-series database** for efficient storage

### Machine Learning Components
- **Energy consumption forecasting** using LSTM networks
- **Anomaly detection** for equipment monitoring
- **Optimization algorithms** for load balancing
- **Predictive maintenance** models

## Key Features

### Smart Automation
- **Automated HVAC control** based on occupancy and weather
- **Dynamic lighting adjustment** using natural light sensors
- **Peak demand management** to reduce utility costs
- **Integration with renewable energy sources**

### Analytics Dashboard
- **Real-time energy consumption** visualization
- **Historical trend analysis** with interactive charts
- **Cost savings calculations** and ROI tracking
- **Environmental impact metrics**

### Mobile Application
- **Remote monitoring** and control capabilities
- **Push notifications** for alerts and insights
- **Energy-saving tips** and recommendations
- **Social features** for community engagement

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (React)
```javascript
// Example component for real-time monitoring
const EnergyMonitor = () => {
  const [consumption, setConsumption] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket('ws://api.sems.com/stream');
    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      setConsumption(JSON.parse(event.data));
    };
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div className="energy-dashboard">
      <ConsumptionChart data={consumption} />
      <SavingsMetrics />
      <ControlPanel />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Backend (Node.js)
```javascript
// Energy optimization algorithm
const optimizeEnergyUsage = async (sensorData) => {
  const predictions = await mlModel.predict(sensorData);
  const recommendations = generateRecommendations(predictions);
  
  return {
    hvacSettings: recommendations.hvac,
    lightingLevels: recommendations.lighting,
    expectedSavings: recommendations.savings
  };
};
```

## Results & Impact

### Energy Savings
- **30% reduction** in overall energy consumption
- **45% decrease** in peak demand charges
